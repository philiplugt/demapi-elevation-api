### How to use

This application is not meant for local use. While you can run it with `flask --app application run --debug` this repository does not contain the necessary the SQL database file, DEM raster files, or ENV files to run properly.

Instead, you can use the live website here: [DEMO](https://demapi.lugtaarde.com)
